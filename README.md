# Project Overview
This is a personal portfolio website that includes the following:

## Introduction about the developer

## Skills and expertise (Full-stack development, DevOps, Networking)

## List of projects with descriptions, links to GitHub repositories

## Contact form (sends messages to a Flask backend)

## Activities and achievements section

Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices

The portfolio website is connected to a MySQL database to store information like the contact form messages and project details. It uses Flask to handle routing and interaction with the database.

Technologies Used
     HTML: Markup language for structuring the content.

     CSS: Styles the website with custom design elements and responsive layout.

     JavaScript: Adds interactivity, including handling the view GitHub button functionality.

     Flask: Python web framework for handling routes and backend logic.

     MySQL: Database for storing project and contact form data.



Features
   # Responsive Design: The website adapts to various screen sizes.

   # Portfolio Section: Displays projects with images, descriptions, and links to GitHub.

   # Contact Form: Users can send a message via a form which is saved to a MySQL database.

   # Skills Section: Displays key skills in web development, DevOps, and networking.

   # Activities Section: Lists volunteer activities and other developer contributions.

   # Social Media Links: Links to Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc., for easy contact.

Installation
   To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites:
# Python 3.x installed

# MySQL installed and running

# Basic knowledge of Flask and MySQL

Steps:
Clone the repository:

   # git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git
   # cd portfolio
Create a Python Virtual Environment:

   # python -m venv venv
   #  source venv/bin/activate   (linux)

Install required Python packages:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the MySQL database:

   #Log into MySQL:

   #mysql -u root -p

Configure Flask to connect to the database:

Setup and Configuration
Database Configuration: Ensure your Flask app is configured to use the correct MySQL database connection string.

Environment Variables: Set up environment variables for sensitive information like database credentials using .env files or Flask's config.from_object() method.

Frontend Customization:
Update the project details in the database or modify the frontend directly for custom content.

Add more projects or activities by updating the projects and activities sections in your HTML files or database.
